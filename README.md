# Keyboard Backlight for Lenovo

[Work in progress]

This is a collection of software utilities for controlling the keyboard backlight on Lenovo laptops under Windows.

Basically:

- [TODO] A Windows service for responding to events (boot, power, user login or unlock, screen on/off) to reset the keyboard backlight status to a set value: Off, Low, or High.
- A Windows system tray application for controlling which state needs to be preserved: Off, Low, or High. This also instructs the companion service which is the set value.

TODO:

- Auto mode for tray application. Have a set mode for day and a set mode for night. Either use a set time for day/night or mirror Night Light behaviour.
